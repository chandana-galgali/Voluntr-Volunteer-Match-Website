      <h2>About Voluntr</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2025, Voluntr was created with a simple vision: to make volunteering accessible to everyone. We saw that many people wanted to help their communities but found it difficult to discover local opportunities that matched their passions and schedules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our platform is designed to be a central hub for community service, connecting dedicated volunteers with non-profits, charities, and local groups who are making a real impact. We are committed to fostering a culture of giving back and empowering individuals to contribute their unique skills and talents for the greater good.
      </p>
      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        To connect, empower, and inspire community engagement by providing a seamless and accessible platform for volunteers and organizations to come together and create positive change.
